   <ul>
    <h5>1.What are the Kinds of problems we see in nature?(Iteration, Recursion, Backtracking)</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong></strong> 1.Iteration:These activities involve repetitive processes or sequential tasks:
                Traveling to college every day (repeated routine).
                Playing the game of chess (turn-based sequences).
                Preparing for an assembly (step-by-step organization).
                The process of learning (daily practice and effort).
                Resource management at a wedding (iterative allocation of resources).
                <li>2.Recursion:These activities involve self-similar patterns or processes that break down into smaller sub-problems:
                    The tree that has been growing every day (branches resembling the whole tree structure).
                    The growth of cauliflower vegetables (fractal patterns).
                    Matryoshka dolls (nested structure with self-similarity).
                    A calendar (days, weeks, and months recur in predictable patterns).</li>
               <li>3.Backtracking:These activities involve exploration, trial and error, or finding solutions by revisiting previous decisions:
                Searching for a new friend’s location (exploring different paths or strategies).
                Solving Sudoku (backtracking to correct mistakes).
                The placement of objects (optimizing arrangements by trying alternatives).</li></li> 
        </ul>
    </li>
   <h5>2.What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different classes of problems and orders of growth.</h5>
   <ul>
    <h6>Algorithm Efficiency and Complexity</h6>
        <li>Time Efficiency:Measures the computational time required to execute an algorithm and represents the number of basic operations performed by an algorithm.</li>
        
       <li>Space Efficiency:Measures the memory (storage) required by an algorithm, tracking how much memory is consumed by the input size and determining how much additional memory is needed to solve a problem.</li> 
        
        <li>Key Principles:A good algorithm executes quickly and saves space in the process. We should find a balance between space and time efficiency (space and time complexity).</li>
        
        <li>The world of computer science, to perform better, we need to write algorithms that are time-efficient and use less memory. Algorithms should be resource-optimized, solving larger problems with limited computing power, and improving user experience and system performance.</li> 
   </ul>
   <h5>3.Takeaway from different design principles from Chapter 2 (can use the notes provided).</h5>
   <ul>
    <li>Decomposition:Break complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces to simplify and solve them effectively.</li>
    <li>Pattern Recognition:Identify recurring patterns in problems to generalize solutions and make predictions.</li>  
    <li>Abstraction:Focus on essential features and ignore unnecessary details to simplify problem-solving</li>
    <li>Brave vs. Cautious Traversal:
    <li>DFS (Brave): Explore deeply before backtracking.
        BFS (Cautious): Explore level by level.
        Pruning:
        Skip unnecessary paths to save time and resources (e.g., N-Queen’s problem).</li>

    <li>Balancing and Rotations:Prevent unbalanced trees in AVL and Red-Black trees to maintain efficient operations.</li>
    <li>Kleene Closure:Find relationships in graphs and determine all possible connections (transitive closure).</li>   
    <li>Pre-Computing:Calculate and store frequently needed results in advance to save runtime (e.g., lookup tables).</li>
    <li>Parental Dominance:Maintain efficiency in heaps by ensuring the root is the largest or smallest element.</li>    
    <li>Prefix and Suffix:Key for pattern matching and string operations in tasks like searching and bioinformatics.</li>    
    <li>Partitioning:Divide problems into smaller parts for recursion, widely used in sorting and searching.</li>   
    <li>Bit Manipulations:Use operations like AND, OR, XOR for memory-efficient algorithms (e.g., Fenwick trees).</li>  
    <li>Memoization:Store previous results in recursive algorithms to avoid redundant calculations.</li>  
    <li>Invariants:Conditions that stay constant during execution, ensuring correctness (e.g., maintaining sorted order).</li>    
    <li>Shortest Path Trees:Show shortest routes from a starting node, useful for navigation and network optimization.</li>
   </ul>
   <h5>4.The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over the problem scenarios (tree, BST, AVL, 2-3, Red-Black, Heap, Trie).</h5>
   <ul>
    <li>Comparison of Trees for Problem Scenarios
        Tree Type	Best For	Strength	Limitation
        BST	Sorted data with moderate updates	Simple structure	Can become unbalanced
        AVL Tree	Frequent lookups and moderate insertions/deletions	Guarantees balance	Costly rotations
        2-3 Tree	Predictable performance in all operations	Consistent height	Complexity of implementation
        Red-Black Tree	Dynamic datasets with frequent updates	Fewer rotations than AVL	Slightly less balanced than AVL
        Heap	Priority-based operations	Efficient min/max retrieval	Not suited for general searching
        Trie	String data and prefix-based operations	Fast prefix search	High memory usage for sparse data</li>
   </ul>
   <h5>5.The need of array query algorithms and their implications. Their applications and principles need to be discussed.</h5>
   <h6>*Principles of Array Query Algorithms</h6>
   <ul>
    <li>Divide and Conquer - Breaking queries into smaller subproblems for efficient computation.
        Dynamic Programming - Storing intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations. Optimization - Balancing preprocessing time with query time to achieve overall efficiency.
        Array Query Algorithms: Overview Core Purpose Array query algorithms are designed to efficiently retrieve, manipulate, or analyze information within large datasets, addressing challenges of: Fast information retrieval Complex data processing Minimizing computational complexity
        Binary Search(Binary index tree) Principle: Divide and conquer strategy Efficiency: O(log n) Requirements: Sorted array Applications: used in Large sorted databases
        Sliding Window Technique Principle: Maintain a window of elements Efficiency: O(n) Applications: used in Network traffic analysis and Signal processing
        Segment Tree Principle: Divide array into segments Efficiency: O(log n) Applications: Range min/max queries</li>
   </ul>
   <h5>6.Differentiate between trees and graphs and their traversals. The applications of each.</h5>
   <ul>
    <li>Tree:A tree is a simple structure with one main "root" and branches that don’t loop back (no cycles). 
        It is like a family tree where each person has only one parent (except for the root).
    <li>Example: A folder structure on your computer.</li>
    <li>Graph: A graph is more complex. It can have cycles (loops) and no specific structure. Nodes (points) can be connected in many different ways, not necessarily hierarchically. 
    <li>Example: A map of cities connected by roads, where you can travel in multiple directions.</li>
    <li>Tree Traversals (Ways to visit nodes in a tree): In-Order: Visit left side, then the node, then right side. Used for: Sorting data in binary search trees.</li>
    <li>Pre-Order: Visit the node first, then the left side, and then the right side. Used for making a copy of the tree.</li>
    <li>Post-Order: Visit the left side first, then the right side, and finally the node. Used for: Deleting nodes.</li>
    <li>Level-Order (BFS): Visit nodes level by level from the root. Used for: Finding the shortest path in simple trees.</li> 
    <li>Graph Traversals (Ways to visit nodes in a graph): DFS (Depth-First Search): Start at one node, go as deep as possible, and backtrack when needed. Used for solving mazes, finding connected components.</li> 
    <li>BFS (Breadth-First Search): Visit neighbors first, then their neighbors, and so on. Used for finding the shortest path in simple graphs, like finding the shortest route on a map.</li> 
    <h6>Applications:</h6>
    <li>Tree Applications: File System: Organizing folders and files. Binary Search Tree (BST): Efficiently finding data in databases. Decision Trees: Used in making decisions, like in machine learning.</li>
    <li>Graph Applications: Social Networks: Connections between people (friends, followers). Maps/Navigation: Finding the shortest route between cities or locations. Web Crawlers: Searching the internet by following links between websites.</li>
   </ul>
   <h5>7.Deliberate on sorting and searching algorithms, the technique behind each, and how they connect to the real world.</h5>
   <h6>Sorting Algorithms</h6>
   <h6>Bubble Sort:</h6>
   <li>How it works: Compares adjacent items and swaps them if they’re out of order. Repeats until the list is sorted.</li>
   <li>Real-world example: Sorting a deck of cards by comparing two cards at a time and swapping them.</li>
   <li>Use: Best for small datasets, inefficient for large ones.</li>
   <h6>Selection Sort:</h6>
   <li>How it works: Finds the smallest item, moves it to the front, and repeats for the rest of the list.</li>
   <li>Real-world example: Organizing books by picking the shortest book first.</li>
   <li>Use: Useful when minimizing swaps, but not the fastest for large datasets.</li>
   <h6>Insertion Sort:</h6>
   <li>How it works: Builds a sorted list one item at a time by inserting each item in its correct position.</li>
   <li>Real-world example: Sorting a deck of cards by picking and placing cards in the right order.</li>
   <li>Use: Great for small or nearly sorted datasets.</li>
   <h6>Merge Sort:</h6>
   <li>How it works: Splits the list, sorts each part, and merges them back together.</li>
   <li>Real-world example: Sorting papers by dividing them into smaller stacks, sorting, and combining them.</li>
   <li>Use: Ideal for large datasets and external sorting.</li>
   <h6>Quick Sort:</h6>
   <li>How it works: Picks a pivot, places smaller elements on one side, larger ones on the other, and repeats.</li>
   <li>Real-world example: Dividing a group by height into smaller groups and sorting each.</li>
   <li>Use: Fast for large datasets, but pivot choice matters.</li>
   <h6>Heap Sort:</h6>
   <li>How it works: Builds a heap and repeatedly extracts the largest or smallest element for the sorted list.</li>
   <li>Real-world example: Priority queue where highest-priority items are handled first.</li>
   <li>Use: Efficient for priority queues and structured sorting.</li>
   <h6>Searching Algorithms</h6>
   <h6>Linear Search:</h6>
   <li>How it works: Checks each item one by one until the target is found.</li>
   <li>Real-world example: Searching for a name in a phone book sequentially.</li>
   <li>Use: Simple but slow for large datasets.</li>
   <h6>Binary Search:</h6>
   <li>How it works: Works on sorted lists, checks the middle, and narrows the search range by half each time.</li>
   <li>Real-world example: Finding a word in a dictionary by dividing the search range.</li>
   <li>Use: Very efficient for sorted lists.</li>
   <h6>Breadth-First Search (BFS):</h6>
   <li>How it works: Explores all nodes at the current level before moving to the next.</li>
   <li>Real-world example: Exploring all rooms on one floor of a building before moving to the next floor.</li>
   <li>Use: Best for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.</li>
   <h6>Depth-First Search (DFS):</h6>
   <li>How it works: Goes as deep as possible along one path before backtracking and trying another.</li>
   <li>Real-world example: Exploring a maze by going deep down one path until a dead end.</li>
   <li>Use: Useful for exploring all paths or solutions in puzzles and games.</li>
   <h6>Real-World Connections</h6>
   <li>Sorting: Used in organizing files, arranging products, or sorting cards.</li>
   <li>Searching: Essential for finding contacts, books, or other data.</li>
   <li>BFS: Helps in GPS systems to find the shortest routes and in social networks to find connections.</li>
   <li>DFS: Useful for puzzle-solving and exploring all possible moves in games.</li>
   <h5>8.Discuss the importance of graph algorithms with respect to spanning trees and shortest paths.</h5>
  <ul>
    <h6>Dijkstra's Algorithm:</h6>
    <li>Purpose: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes.</li>
    <li>Type: Single-source shortest path algorithm.</li>
    <li>Use: Best for weighted graphs with non-negative weights.</li>
    <h6>Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:</h6>
    <li>Purpose: Calculates shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.</li>
    <li>Type: All-pairs shortest path algorithm.</li>
    <li>Use: Suitable for dense graphs.</li>
    <h6>Prim's Algorithm:</h6>
    <li>Purpose: Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph.</li>
    <li>Type: Greedy algorithm.</li>
    <li>Use: Ideal for network design and minimizing total connection cost.</li>
    <h6>Shortest Path:</h6>
    <li>Purpose: Finds the minimum path between nodes.</li>
    <li>Examples: Dijkstra’s, Bellman-Ford algorithms.</li>
    <li>Use: Navigation systems and network optimization.</li>
    <h6>Spanning Trees:</h6>
    <li>Purpose: Optimizes network design by connecting all nodes with minimal edges.</li>
    <li>Examples: Prim’s, Kruskal’s algorithms.</li>
    <li>Use: Efficient for designing layouts like electrical grids or road networks.</li>
  </ul>
   <h5>9. Discuss the different studied algorithm design techniques.</h5>
   <h6>Algorithm Design Techniques:</h6>
   <ul>
    <li>Brute Force: Solve problems by trying all possible solutions, guaranteed to find the correct one but inefficient for large inputs.</li>
    <li>Divide and Conquer: Break a problem into smaller subproblems, solve them recursively, and combine results (e.g., Merge Sort).</li>
    <li>Decrease and Conquer: Reduce the problem size by solving a smaller instance of the problem and building up to the solution (e.g., Insertion Sort).</li>
    <li>Transform and Conquer: Transform the problem into an easier form and solve it more efficiently (e.g., binary search).</li>
    <li>Greedy Algorithm: Make the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping it leads to the global optimum (e.g., Huffman Coding).</li>
    <h6>Algorithms:</h6>
    <li>Boyer-Moore Algorithm: A string searching algorithm that efficiently finds a substring within a text by skipping sections of the text.</li>
    <li>Rabin-Karp Algorithm: Uses hashing to find a substring in a string, efficient for multiple pattern searches.</li>
    <li>Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Finds the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph by iteratively selecting the closest node.</li>
    <li>Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: Finds the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph, using dynamic programming.</li>
    <li>Kruskal’s Algorithm: Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) by sorting edges and connecting nodes with the smallest weights without forming cycles.</li>
    <li>Prim’s Algorithm: Finds the MST by growing a tree one edge at a time, always selecting the smallest edge that connects a node to the tree.</li>
    <li>Warshall’s Algorithm: Computes the transitive closure of a directed graph, determining reachability between all pairs of vertices.</li>
    <p>There are several key algorithm design techniques, each serving different problem-solving needs. Backtracking explores all possible solutions and discards those that don’t work, useful for problems like N-Queens or Sudoku. Divide and conquer splits a problem into smaller sub-problems, solves them individually, and then combines the results, as seen in merge sort and quick sort. Brute force relies on trying every possible solution to find the correct one, used in algorithms like the Rabin-Karp algorithm for string matching. Graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s and Floyd-Warshall help find the shortest path in graphs, while Kruskal’s algorithm is used for finding the minimum spanning tree.
